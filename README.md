## Overview

This is a solution to a Frontend Mentor challenge strictly using HTML and CSS. This has not only been useful to me in applying my knowledge but also in learning more and better approaches to use when coding.

## My process

I began by structuring the webpage using HTML
and then giving it proper styling and positioning using CSS.
I was able to centrally place the QR-code component using margin: auto, thus enabling it to be responsive to various browser widths. I also used Google Fonts to get the specified font families while the colours and font sizes were indicated. The application of padding, margins and border-radius, on the other hand, was based on intuition.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
One thing I learned through this project was how to make use of Git repositories.
I was also able to understand how to search for content online which I was told was a useful skill to a web developer.
Regarding HTML and CSS specifically, I gained better knowledge on how to make use of Google fonts and how to apply them on a webpage, as well as how making use of widths in percentages enhances your website responsivity.

### Continued development

Responsivity
Semantic HTML
Use of grid and flexbox

### Useful resources
